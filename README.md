# Requirements 
More detailed to come

Ruby and the Sass compiler (seems to be present on the ruby gitlab image? Seems unlikely)
Node and the netlify cli
dotnetcore and the fornax cli

This is just a quick note for setting up gitlab. Once I have gitlab working I'll turn this into something real.

# Deploying

I'm using the netlify CLI, because the Continuous Deployment provided by Netlify won't work with any dotnet tools (at least not yet). However you can still just use the netlify tools.
