# Requirements

Ruby and the Sass compiler
Node and the netlify cli
dotnetcore and the fornax cli

This is just a quick note for setting up gitlab

# Deploying

I'm using the netlify CLI, because the Continuous Deployment provided by Netlify won't work with any dotnet tools (at least not yet). However you can still just use the netlify tools.
